## Methods

### 1. Text Cleaning

> 1.1 Converting from SGML/XML to CSV

All of the EEBO-TCP texts are stored in SGML/XML format. In order to use these texts as inputs in our word embedding models, we need to extract the relevant information from each EEBO file. Following the extraction process, we must clean the text of any unwanted characters (e.g. punctuation, non-latin alphabet characters, html/xml tags, etc.), and then store the cleaned texts in csv files.
