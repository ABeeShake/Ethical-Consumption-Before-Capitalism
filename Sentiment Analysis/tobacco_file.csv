custom in drinking of tobacco give great credit and authority to descent in judgment of tobacco from those authors before aleaged the use and practise of tobacco i take it to be vs by the name of tobacco is without all method and received for the smoke of tobacco seems to the fauorits thereof after their unsavoury and unpleasant tobacco pipe galen in his comment the frequet use of this tobacco for the siccety tried of justly inferred here of that tobacco simply taken without respect of you to offer this their tobacco after one and the self a puff of a smoky tobacco pipe yea some of them cure or ease by this tobacco but i assure you many fancy with the use of tobacco it might be suffiient for for by the force of tobacco the mouth throat and stomach against the ordinary use of tobacco is taken from the excess often use the feume of tobacco no doubt they should increase extreme violent tried heat of tobacco makes it far unfit unwholesome to bee over bold with tobacco for it doth not only therefore are the patrons of tobacco to bee beeleeued in this cured with an inusion of tobacco lease in white wine steeped you can be found between tobacco and a fever tercian or as they contend to prove tobacco to be a great nursery bodies and breath the loathsome tobacco sent long time after so any respect bee granted to tobacco both for that his savour taken his mornings draft of tobacco with the fume whereof he and daily use of drincking tobacco had accustomed his stomach to more fitly performed then by tobacco it self for as it fourth reason before aleadged that tobacco is not familiarly to be a violent purge to prove tobacco to bee a strong and to purge most violently furthermore tobacco is found to be of the daily use of this tobacco have brought themselves to flexes by the frequent use of tobacco after that they had once untimely and vulgar use of tobacco being before proved a violent engendered of our nourishments but tobacco was showed before to deprive for our bodies and therefore tobacco must needs be said to radical moisture before specified moreover tobacco by means of his great decayed by the use of tobacco hereby it must needs in and for certain proof that tobacco dries up the sperm seed reason the fifth argument against tobacco was that it dissipateth natural long and continual use of tobacco do with the more difficulty reason the sixth reason against tobacco was that this plant seems poisoned substance and nature of tobacco is manifested and proved by be enphorbium praecipitate eleterium and tobacco it self which last as may be added thereunto that tobacco is in this respect more there used in this indian tobacco which the more simple sincere cassia of rhubarb but this tobacco now in use is of the poisoned force of this tobacco to any thing more aptly left in the stomach by tobacco receives no ease by any thing else whatsoever but by tobacco only eftsoon reiterated and resumed it self but that of tobacco hath only a cocaine ease time by the fume of tobacco received but after perfect and perfect and absolute cure this tobacco by it self a thousand do take the fume of tobacco without hurt or inconvenience and for the custom of taking tobacco with vs is in that but that in small quantity tobacco may be taken of any may be obiectedobiection that if tobacco were of that poisoned nature monardus in his treatise of tobacco to this may be answeredanswere and familiar use of this tobacco from their infancy hath confirmed little used to take this tobacco fume or other poison whatsoever west indians have of their tobacco but for want of that which is alleged of the tobacco patrons for her commendation that then is the fume of tobacco the reason of this profit the force and power of tobacco doth work drawing and purging and dangerous so truly is tobacco being taken of such as reason the seventh reason against tobacco was that this herb seemed monardus in his treatise of tobacco doth sufficiently witness saying the their princes drink of this tobacco fume with the vigour and to bee the author of tobacco and of the knowledge thereof not the least argument against tobacco was that it is a themselves to the fume of tobacco for first touching the natural sediment it shall contain but tobacco thickened and engrosseth the blood engrosseth the blood and therefore tobacco engendered in vs a greater to thicken the blood but tobacco wastes and absumeth the liquid of our blood and therefore tobacco may justly be said to as commonly doo drink this tobacco for thereby doo they purge by the inordinate

now too too fearfully the untimely taking of filthy tobacco fumes if thy mind be for very love of their tobacco traffic and other disordered courses fumes because these their filthy tobacco fumes are

especially respect insatiable sucking in of filthy tobacco fumes do even ordinarily attend insatiable swilling in of filthy tobacco fumes as the shadow follows experience that these our filthy tobacco
