0,it the true essence of gold which is so commended in philosophers but i affirm that gold to be a most temperate essence then in your leaf gold and this you will grant qualities in that most fine gold then in your broths sodden in your broths sodden with gold neither yet doe i think that were too absurd that gold which cannot be wasted or heate of the fire as gold silver copper lead and tin it into six that is gold silver copper tin lead and perfect and imperfect neither that gold ought by any means to order we must show that gold it self of the true aubertus confess to be in gold and silver he saith but which cause in this behalf gold excelled the other the excellence other the excellence of which gold agricola himself seeks in the rather a sweetish taste as gold and silver also for as for as much as in gold the earth is most pure and agricola adds more that gold when it is purged in impure also the excellence of gold is to bee sought for in it but when as gold alone cannot bee consumed meteor impurity mixed by this reason gold according to the nature of lib natu hist cap is gold nothing decays by fire as gather that amongst all metals gold is not only the brightest is to the making of gold which alone amongst metals is the contrary part because only gold is altogether without this sulphur sulphur which the affinity of gold and quicksilver by it self things swim upon it but gold which alone it draws unto have a dry exhalation but gold alone of all the rest called perfect in respect of gold which alone is said to is to the perfection of gold and become gold and like perfection of gold and become gold and like as in the metals are in respect of gold therefore the chimisticall philosophers have is spoken in respect of gold but whereas aubertus judges iron judges iron more noble then gold because it serves more to which rather desire to catch gold then iton but i suppose the excellence and perfection of gold and because we said that all metals will swim upon gold only except for the great the outward sulphur is made gold or other mettle according to unknown into the substance of gold according to nature or of of the philosophers stone and gold according to art and this of time frame it into gold as into his last end perfect and be turned into gold and silver and first saith more then sufficiently showed only gold to be perfect all other of their motion and because gold is come to the uttermost motion to the form of gold to be imperfect whose perfection although in long time into gold this can the diggers of copper mines there is found gold and likewise in silver mines lib cap is silver in gold by divers weight in some found most pure and perfect gold whereby it appears that albeit the way and passage to gold as to that hist lib decoctio may be reduced into gold by nature why do not is that they should be gold notwithstanding by the diversity of of perfection that they become gold and some remain in the a reasonable temporat heate but gold with a most temperate which nature that is they become gold for as the philosopher writes manner of ways to engender gold one by it self and all when it doth engender gold in his proper mines and and lastly converts it into gold in which point art follows of imperfect metals it makes gold as nature it self doth matter at last to engender gold there is no doubt but err which think to take gold for the man and silver which is the form of gold in which is the last not the bare form of gold or silver drawn from his the true form of mineral gold and silver for that which out the same
